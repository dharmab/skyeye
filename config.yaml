# Sample YAML configuration file for SkyEye.

# New to YAML? Here's a crash course.
#
# Comments:
# - Comments are lines that start with the '#' symbol. Comments are ignored
# when the config file is loaded.
# - You'll need to uncomment the example configuration values if you want to
# customize them. You can do this by deleting the '#' at the start of that
# line.
#
# Setting configuration values:
# - A key is a unique identifier, followed by a colon and a space, and then the
# value.
# - Values can be strings (text), booleans (true/false), numbers, or lists of
# strings.
#   - Strings can be enclosed in quotes to disambiguate them if needed.
# - Some values are time intervals. You can specify "m" for minutes and "s" for
# seconds. For example, "90s" and "1m30s" are both 90 seconds.
# - You can check the defaults by passing the --help flag to the executable.

# SPEECH RECOGNITION
# You MUST download a whisper.cpp model from
# https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/main and provide the path
# to the model file here.
#
# The small English-only model provides a good balance between performance, RAM
# usage and quality.
#whisper-model: ggml-small.en.bin
#
# The medium English-only model has better quality, but requires a powerful CPU
# and additional RAM.
#whisper-model: ggml-medium.en.bin
#
# Only resort to the tiny model if the small model is too slow. It has poor
# speech recognition quality.
#whisper-model: ggml-tiny.en.bin

# TACVIEW
# Telemetry service address. Set this to the host and port of the TacView
# real-time telemetry service for your DCS World installation.
# DCS running on the same computer:
#telemetry-address: localhost:42674
# DCS running remotely:
#telemetry-address: dcs.example.com:42674
#
# If your TacView telemetry is password-protected, set the password here.
#telemetry-password: tacviewpasswordgoeshere

# SIMPLERADIO-STANDALONE
# SRS server address. Set this to the host and port of the SRS server.
# SRS server running on the same computer:
#srs-address: localhost:5002
# SRS server running remotely:
#srs-address: srs.example.com:5002
#
# SRS EAM password. Set this to the password used to connect to External AWACS
# Mode in SRS.
#srs-eam-password: eampasswordgoeshere
#
# SRS frequency. Set this to the AM radio frequency the GCI should listen and
# speak on. Be sure to choose a frequency that all allied aircraft in your
# mission can tune on their radios. Some aircraft cannot manually tune some of
# their radios, so you may need to choose a frequency matching a preset
# configured in the DCS mission editor.
#srs-frequency: 251.0

# IDENTITY
# Set the callsign to whatever you want the GCI to use as the callsign. Good
# callsigns should be in English, two or three syllables, and easy to
# pronounce. Real-world examples include: Baron, Chalice, Darkstar, Disco,
# Focus, Goliath, Magic, Sentry and Wizard. If you don't provide a callsign, a
# random callsign is selected from a set of Ace Combat/Project Wingman easter
# eggs. Please do _not_ use the callsign "Overlord" to avoid any possible
# confusion with OverlordBot. I do not want any confused players to send bug
# reports to the wrong project!
#callsign: Focus
# Alternatively you can provide a list of callsigns and one will be randomly
# selected.
#callsigns: [Wizard, Magic, Goliath]
#
# Set the coalition this GCI will serve - either "red" or "blue"
#coalition: blue

# SPEECH SYNTHESIS
# Select a voice (either feminine or masculine). If you don't select one, one
# is selected for you.
#voice: feminine
#
# See --help for further customization if the GCI speaks too fast for you to
# understand.

# BEHAVIOR
# By default, the GCI broadcasts an updated PICTURE if a PICTURE has not been
# given for two minutes. I find this feature works very well for smaller
# missions like Retribution campaigns, where the PICTURE helps maintain
# situational awareness. However, I understand that on a large server with lots
# of enemy aircraft this could become annoying, so the feature is customizable.
#
# You can disable PICTURE broadcasts by setting auto-picture to false. Players
# may still request a PICTURE on demand, but automatic broadcasts will be
# disabled.
#auto-picture: true
#
# You can customize the PICTURE broadcast interval. I find values between 2 and
# 5 minutes work best.
#auto-picture-interval: 2m
#
# By default, the GCI monitors any friendly aircraft which tunes onto the
# configured SRS frequency. The GCI will broadcast a threat call if a hostile
# aircraft approaches close enough to a monitored friendly aircraft to satisfy
# threat criteria. Threat criteria are dynamic; for example, a Su-27 Flanker is
# considered to be a threat at a greater range than a Su-17 Fitter.
#
# You can disable threat monitoring by setting threat-monitoring to false. I
# don't recommend this because it greatly reduces situational awareness. But
# hey, it's your video game and I'm not your dad.
#threat-monitoring: true
#
# Threat calls are repeated if the threat criteria are still met after a
# cooldown period. You can customize how often the bot rebroadcasts threat
# calls.
#threat-monitoring-interval: 3m
#
# At a close enough range, any hostile aircraft with air-to-air capabilities is
# considred a threat regardless of its platform. The default value (25 nautical
# miles) is a reasonable choice for a modern setting, but you may wish to tune
# this based on mission requirements and player skill level.
#mandatory-threat-radius: 25

# LOGGING
#
# Log verbosity. Most should leave this at the default INFO level, unless
# troubleshooting an issue.
#log-level: info
#
# Log format. "pretty" is easier to read in a console, "json" is easier to
# search/query later.
#log-format: pretty
